* Consistency between reruns: fi_3
* The reason that fi_3 failed is that I was standing in front of the anchor.
 - All reruns passed.
 - Confirmed by standing in front of the anchor again.

* fi_4 is even better for showing consistence.
* fi_4 shows the same test with and without injected faults, and the fault is just big enough to cause a failure.
* The failure is very consistent and repeatable.
